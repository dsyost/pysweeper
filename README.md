<h1>Pysweeper</h1>
<p>pysweeper is a text based version of the classic game minesweeper.  The rules work the exact same way.  As for the program itself I broke
it up into two diffrent parts.  The first is a class called sweeper, this is were the logic for the board is handled and could also be imported
as a library if need be.  The second part of the program is the user interface which is just simple a while loop doing things to the object
based on the input.<p>
